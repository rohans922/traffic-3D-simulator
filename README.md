Vehicle Simulation - Rohan Shaiva

GAME:
The goal of this game is to avoid crashes at all cost.

To do this, you will have to click each car for it to stop at
the intersection. You can then click it again to proceed.

You gain points for every intersection crossed, and you lose if
you crash.

You can also press Enter to randomize the car colors.

MECHANICS:
This program uses three.js to function. Due to the submission size restrictions,
I could not provide this assignment with the folder "libs" with all the three.js
components. Please copy the three.js libraries into the libs folder for this to function.
